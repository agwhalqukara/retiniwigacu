However, she has an ex-husband because she was previously married. Her marriage was short-lived and happened when she was only 18.</strong></p><p>Lana Rhoades is a 27-year-old American podcaster, social media influencer, and former pornographic film actress born on 6th September 1996 in McHenry, Illinois, United States. Although she first came into public recognition as an adult film actress, she has since shifted from the industry and now established herself as a social media star and model. Away from her career success, fans are always curious to know everything about her love life.</p><h2><strong>Is Lana Rhoades Married?</strong></h2><p>Lana Rhoades is currently not married, but has tasted marriage in the past. This may come as a surprise to many people, including her fans, as they might not be aware that Rhoades was at some point a married woman. This is because the marriage happened and ended before she became popularly known. The McHenry-born and her former husband, a Syrian who is simply known as Jons, met and married when she was much younger.</p><p>However, there is little or no information about their marriage timeline on the internet. Lana started working in the adult entertainment industry at age 19 in 2016 which was when she came into the limelight. Whereas her marriage had already ended when she was 18. This is the reason nothing is publicly known about it.</p><p>Jons is said to be an automotive enthusiast, other than that nothing else is recorded about him. Lana and her ex-husband did not only have a private marriage, but also a non-dramatic divorce that many people also did not get to know about.</p><h2><strong>Is Lana Rhoades In a Relationship? Who Is She Dating?</strong></h2><p>As much as the public knows, Lana Rhoades is not in any relationship or dating anybody at the moment. However, since she rose to fame, she has had a fair share of public opinions and speculations about her love life. But her last officially confirmed relationship ended in February 2021, and since then, she has not confirmed any other relationship.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rhoades once opened up that her previous work as a porn star has really been an issue in her past relationships as any man she got close to would usually make her believe that no man would genuinely love her because of that.</p><h2><strong>Lana Rhoades and Mike Majlak’s Relationship</strong></h2><p>Rhoades dated Mike Majlak, an American YouTuber, podcaster, and author in 2020. They were introduced to each other by Logan Paul and their relationship lasted for a year and three months although it was on and off. During this time, they appeared on several podcasts and vlogs together and fans loved them being a couple. However, their relationship began to get toxic and they first broke up in October 2020.</p><p>They fixed things up and reconciled some days later, but in February 2021, they permanently broke up and went their separate ways. In addition to being inappropriate with women, Rhoades stated that the major reason she broke things with Majlak was that they had twice planned to move in together, but Mike would always come up with excuses at the last minute, so when it happened the second time, she had to call it quits.</p><p>Regardless, Lana Rhoades and Mike Majlak remained good friends to date and still work together. Lana severally appears in Mike’s vlogs and podcast, and vice versa.</p><h2><strong>Lana Rhoades and Logan Paul’s Relationship</strong></h2><p>Logan Paul and Lana Rhoades are not and have never been in a romantic relationship. Although it is not known exactly when they came to know each other, the two have only maintained a good friendship over the past few years. It is not clear exactly how, when, and what sparked their relationship rumors, but what is clear is that they never dated.</p><h3><strong>Lana Rhoades’ Boyfriends and Relationship History</strong></h3><p>Apart from Mike Majlak, who was the only officially recognized man she has dated, Lana has since her rise to fame been embroiled in a few other romantic relationship rumors. While it is possible she dated some of those men, others are only rumors. After her relationship with Mike ended, in June 2021, she reportedly started dating NBA star, Kevin Durant.</p><p>Their relationship was never confirmed by either of them so it is only seen a rumor, which was swept under the rugs just after a month. Lana, meanwhile, once divulged that her second-ever boyfriend was a male adult film co-star. Although she didn’t reveal his name, records show that one of the first male stars she worked with was Mike Adriano, and it is assumed he is the one she was referring to.</p><p>Rhoades described their relationship as amazing and Mike Adriano as a wonderful companion for her during her lonely days. Moreover, Lana in one of her interviews had admitted to having a crush on Adriano.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Lana Rhoades’s Child?</strong></h2><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Lana Rhoades</a> welcomed her first child, a son named Milo, in January 2022. Upon Milo’s arrival, people started getting curious to know who his father was. But, Lana seems to be intentionally economical with disclosing information about the father of her son.</p><p>However, after some months of ignoring people’s curiosity and unending questions about who Milo’s father is as well as wild speculations that have pointed to many people as the possible father, Rhoades decided to publicly give out some insights into the identity of the man. According to the mother of one, her baby daddy is an NBA player and is Libra.</p><p>She further revealed that the same man in question rejected her and told her to go “f*** herself” after she broke the news of her pregnancy to him. Her friend, Logan Paul, also confirmed this news in an episode of his podcasts where he said that Lana Rhoades’ baby daddy is an NBA star.</p><p>Upon breaking this news, the two major people that came to mind were Kevin Durant and Blake Griffin. Kevin Durant’s name came up because they had dated in the past and Milo has mixed race. But, Kevin was taken out of the equation after Lana stated that their date was very brief and didn’t make any progress.</p><p>Now, Blake Griffi became and has remained the one being proposed as Milo’s father. Conclusions over this claim were made when Lana took her son to sneakers shopping and fans were quick enough to notice the striking resemblance he has with Blake. Yet, there is still no confirmation of this, but many believe that the truth about Lana Rhoades’s baby daddy will certainly surface sooner or later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecuapZplop28orDErGSbp6mbv6qxzZ1kqKpdmbymv4ysn55lmJbDpnnAZp%2Buq5KWu6V7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-lana-rhoades-s-boyfriend-or-does-she-have-a-husband.html&text=Who%20Is%20Lana%20Rhoadess%20Boyfriend%20or%20Does%20She%20Have%20a%20Husband%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-lana-rhoades-s-boyfriend-or-does-she-have-a-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-lana-rhoades-s-boyfriend-or-does-she-have-a-husband.html&title=Who%20Is%20Lana%20Rhoadess%20Boyfriend%20or%20Does%20She%20Have%20a%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-lana-rhoades-s-boyfriend-or-does-she-have-a-husband.html&title=Who%20Is%20Lana%20Rhoadess%20Boyfriend%20or%20Does%20She%20Have%20a%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-lana-rhoades-s-boyfriend-or-does-she-have-a-husband.html&title=Who%20Is%20Lana%20Rhoadess%20Boyfriend%20or%20Does%20She%20Have%20a%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-lana-rhoades-s-boyfriend-or-does-she-have-a-husband.html&description=Who%20Is%20Lana%20Rhoadess%20Boyfriend%20or%20Does%20She%20Have%20a%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dove-s-soft-murmur.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dove's soft murmur">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./preferences.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Preferences>Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
