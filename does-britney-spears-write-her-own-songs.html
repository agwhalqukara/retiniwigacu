It was then passed to Spears, who accepted it, seeing its potential.&nbsp;</p><p>She told <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard</a> “When I started working with Max Martin in Sweden, he played the demo for ‘Baby One More Time’ for me, and I knew from the start it was one of those songs you want to hear again and again. It just felt really right.”</p><p>The album has 11 tracks, none of which were written by Spears.&nbsp;</p><p>Most songs on the album were written by <a href=# rel=noopener>Eric Foster White</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Max Martin</a>, along with other songwriters and producers. White and Martin produced Spears’ first album.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Making Her Mark</h2><p>Spears’ second studio album <a href=# rel=noopener>Oops!…I Did It Again</a> was also an international success.&nbsp;</p><p>It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200, and <a href=# rel=noopener>broke</a> the record at the time for highest debut-week album sales by a female artist.&nbsp;</p><p>The song has 12 tracks, most of which were <a href=# rel=noopener>written</a> by her producer Max Martin along with other songwriters.</p><p>However, Spears did co-write one song on the album titled <a href=# rel=noopener>Dear Diary</a>, which was the first song she received writing credits for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She had significantly greater contribution on her third eponymous album <a href=# rel=noopener>Britney</a> (2001). The album had 12 tracks, and Spears co-wrote 5 of these.&nbsp;</p><p>Spears became even more involved in the songwriting for her fourth album <a href=# rel=noopener>In The Zone</a> (2003).</p><p>In the 13-track album, she co-wrote 9 songs, <a href=# rel=noopener>collaborating</a> with huge names in the music industry such as <a href=# rel=noopener>Madonna</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Blackout</a> is perhaps Spears’ most critically acclaimed album, and she co-wrote 2 of the 12 songs on the album.&nbsp;</p><p>The rest were written by various talented artists such as <a href=# rel=noopener>Pharrell Williams</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Danja</a> (Nate Hills).</p><p>The singer had a similar pattern of contribution in her later albums.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Critical Reception</h2><p>Spears received widespread <a href=# rel=noopener>criticism</a> after some fans noticed she did not pen any of the tracks on her <a href=# rel=noopener>Femme Fatale</a> album.&nbsp;</p><p>Songwriter Heather Bright, who wrote <a href=# rel=noopener>Trouble for Me</a> for Spears, came to her defense, <a href=# rel=noopener>saying</a>, “The media is talking trash about how Britney didn’t write any of the songs on her album … HELLO! Wake up everybody! NONE OF THESE ARTISTS WRITE THEIR OWN SONGS!!!!!!”</p><p>She praised the singer for not claiming false credits, and went on to suggest that many musicians demand credits for songs they did not write.</p><p>Ke$ha, who wrote <a href=# rel=noopener>Till The World Ends</a> on Spears’ Femme Fatal album, <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> in an interview with MTV Canada “She’s an amazing singer, an amazing performer and she’s an icon. I don’t think that that means she has to write.”</p><p>Claude Kelly, who wrote <a href=# rel=noopener>Gasoline</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> that although Spears did not write her songs, she still has control over the creative process.&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly stated, “She’s very, very much in control of what she records, how she sounds, how she portrays herself on the record.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jp2mnqtdl7%2BqwM2esGaroJqus7%2BMsKmirJVitaa%2BjKiup2WjpLuov44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdoes-britney-spears-write-her-own-songs.html&text=Does%20Britney%20Spears%20Write%20Her%20Own%20Songs%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-britney-spears-write-her-own-songs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-britney-spears-write-her-own-songs.html&title=Does%20Britney%20Spears%20Write%20Her%20Own%20Songs%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdoes-britney-spears-write-her-own-songs.html&title=Does%20Britney%20Spears%20Write%20Her%20Own%20Songs%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-britney-spears-write-her-own-songs.html&title=Does%20Britney%20Spears%20Write%20Her%20Own%20Songs%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-britney-spears-write-her-own-songs.html&description=Does%20Britney%20Spears%20Write%20Her%20Own%20Songs%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./history-uncovered-explores-the-lake-michigan-ufo-incident-of-1994.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="History Uncovered Explores The Lake Michigan UFO Incident Of 1994">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./demons-and-saviors-season-1-release-date-cast-plot-spoiler-trailer-and-important-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Demons and Saviors Season 1: Release Date, Cast, Plot, Spoiler, Trailer, And Important Details">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
