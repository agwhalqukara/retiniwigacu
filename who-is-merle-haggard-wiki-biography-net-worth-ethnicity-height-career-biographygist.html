Haggard suffered severe trauma with the passing of his father in 1945, which had an impact on him for the rest of his youth. He was often transferred to juvenile correctional facilities to try to reform him after becoming extremely rebellious, but it simply made matters worse.</p><p>His music career actually kick-started in 1956, when he was given an opportunity to star in a local TV show called Chuck Wagon. The governor of California only completely pardoned him for all of his prior convictions in 1972, when his celebrity started to spread across the nation.</p><h2>Merle Haggard Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Merle Haggard was born on April 6, 1937, and passed away at the age of 79. He was 1.75 meters tall.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/download-1-77.jpg alt="Merle Haggard" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Merle Haggard Career</h2><p>His career’s early years weren’t particularly illustrious or prosperous. He gradually began recording songs and albums for Tally Records, but they did not have a wide appeal that was anticipated. His debut track, which unexpectedly became a national hit in 1966, served as the catalyst for his first top-10 national record, which officially launched his music career in the public eye. Haggard was among the most well-known country singers in the world by 1970.</p><p>Haggard’s renown was further elevated on a global scale in 1972 thanks to a semi-autobiographical music video created by Capital Cities TV Productions. Nine of Haggard’s twelve songs that were released between 1981 and 1985 were universally praised and even peaked at number one on several charts. He was severely affected by his divorce from his third wife, which led to him becoming a violent drinker. Surprisingly, he managed to bounce back quickly enough to take home the Grammy for Best Male Vocal Performance in a Remake in 1984.</p><p>By releasing contentious songs that CBS Records in Nashville formally forbade, Haggard, demonstrated that he was still fighting the system and the government even in the final stages of his career. Despite having health issues in the middle, even his most recent releases in 2008 and 2010 ended up being wildly popular.</p><h2>Merle Haggard’s Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Merle Haggard’s net worth</strong> was $40 million at the year of his death. According to estimates and calculations given by sources, his musical profession was the sole source of the $40 million. In addition to countless music events and his performances in various other shows, his CDs had a very broad commercial appeal and provided him with the majority of his revenue.</p><p>Haggard was aware of his devotion despite the fact that his career had a bleak and depressing beginning. Despite all of those challenges and setbacks, he returned to the world to share a salient aspect of his soul and to continue to inspire people.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiknqqcmnqprcagmKucXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-merle-haggard-wiki-biography-net-worth-ethnicity-height-career-biographygist.html&text=Who%20is%20Merle%20Haggard%3f%20Wiki%2c%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Height%2c%20Career%20%28Biographygist%29&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-merle-haggard-wiki-biography-net-worth-ethnicity-height-career-biographygist.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-merle-haggard-wiki-biography-net-worth-ethnicity-height-career-biographygist.html&title=Who%20is%20Merle%20Haggard%3f%20Wiki%2c%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Height%2c%20Career%20%28Biographygist%29" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-merle-haggard-wiki-biography-net-worth-ethnicity-height-career-biographygist.html&title=Who%20is%20Merle%20Haggard%3f%20Wiki%2c%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Height%2c%20Career%20%28Biographygist%29" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-merle-haggard-wiki-biography-net-worth-ethnicity-height-career-biographygist.html&title=Who%20is%20Merle%20Haggard%3f%20Wiki%2c%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Height%2c%20Career%20%28Biographygist%29" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-merle-haggard-wiki-biography-net-worth-ethnicity-height-career-biographygist.html&description=Who%20is%20Merle%20Haggard%3f%20Wiki%2c%20Biography%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Height%2c%20Career%20%28Biographygist%29" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./band-behind-girls-boys.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Band behind Girls &amp;amp; Boys">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pure-heart-dish-on-new-movie-celeb-secrets-country.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pure Heart Dish on New Movie  Celeb Secrets Country">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
