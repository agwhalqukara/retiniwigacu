paramedics.</p><p>The Memphis Police Department has not confirmed the identity of the victim or the motive of the shooting.</p><p>No suspect information has been released and the investigation is ongoing.</p><p>However, several sources on social media have claimed that Taylor was the victim and that he was killed in retaliation for Young Dolph’s murder.</p><p>Some have also suggested that
