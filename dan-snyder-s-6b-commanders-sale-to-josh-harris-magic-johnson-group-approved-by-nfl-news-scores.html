Talk about God's perfect timing. This was the right organization for me to be a part of given it's global appeal, history of winning, and the diverse fanbase and DMV…</p><p>Commanders fans got the news they had wanted to hear for months when reports surfaced earlier this year of an agreement between Harris' group and Washington's current owners, Dan and Tanya Snyder.</p><p>However, the saga was far from over.</p><p>Since Harris and Johnson only struck a nonexclusive accord, the Snyders remained free to explore competing bids. ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>John Keim</a> reported April 13 that Harris and Johnson were still in a "head-to-head race" with Canadian billionaire Steve Apostolopoulos.</p><p>Houston Rockets majority governor Tilman Fertitta <a href=# rel=noopener>backed out</a> once the bidding passed $5.6 billion. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos <a href=# rel=noopener>didn't attempt</a> to make a last-minute push, either, leaving Apostolopoulos as the only viable rival for Harris and Johnson.</p><p>On May 12, Harris and the Snyders announced they had entered into a purchase agreement, effectively eliminating the likelihood of any drama at the eleventh hour:</p>Ian Rapoport <span class=acct>@RapSheet</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Commanders?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Commanders&lt;/a> and Josh Harris have a deal. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ct4TbE5Vb2">pic.twitter.com/ct4TbE5Vb2&lt;/a></p><p>With that step completed, a few hurdles remained. The NFL's finance committee needed to sign off, and then an affirmative vote from three-fourths of the NFL's fellow owners was required as the last step.</p><p>There wasn't much reason to think Harris and Johnson's offer would encounter any roadblocks given their respective track records.</p><p>Harris already has significant ownership stakes in the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and NHL's New Jersey Devils. And in addition to being an NBA legend, Johnson is a co-owner of multiple sports teams (MLB's Los Angeles Dodgers, MLS's Los Angeles FC and the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks).</p><p>Thursday's news officially concludes one of the most disastrous ownership tenures in American sports over the last few decades.</p>Mina Kimes <span class=acct>@minakimes</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>A quick thought on one of the most shameful ownership tenures in the history of professional sports coming to an end (and why this shouldn't be over for the NFL). &lt;a href="https://t.co/h5l8UjUny8">pic.twitter.com/h5l8UjUny8&lt;/a></p><p>The Commanders were one of the NFL's premier teams across the 1980s and into the early 1990s thanks to their success under head coach Joe Gibbs. With Snyder at the helm, they became mired in mediocrity.</p><p>Washington made six playoff appearances after he was approved as owner in 1999, and it cycled through numerous head coaches and starting quarterbacks in pursuit of any sort of consistency.</p>Chad Ryan <span class=acct>@ChadwikoTWW</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>The road was re-dedicated in front of porta-potties.&lt;br>&lt;br>The sideline number tribute was in the area where VIPs stand.&lt;br>&lt;br>The half-time ceremony involved no speeches or recognition.&lt;br>&lt;br>The owner wore a hoodie to the pre-game meeting with family. &lt;a href="https://t.co/HeroBghuK8">pic.twitter.com/HeroBghuK8&lt;/a></p><p>Off the field, Snyder <a href=# rel=noopener>oversaw a toxic atmosphere</a> internally within the Commanders as well. In July 2021, the NFL <a href=# rel=noopener>fined</a> Snyder $10 million after an investigation found a "highly unprofessional" environment within the organization's offices. He also ceded day-to-day team operations.</p><p>Shortly after the sale was announced on Thursday, the NFL fined Snyder $60 million stemming from Mary Jo White's investigation into the organization. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>the report's findings</a>, the investigators "sustained both Tiffani Johnston's allegation of sexual harassment by Mr. Snyder and Jason Friedman's allegation of deliberate underreporting of NFL revenues by the Club to avoid its VTS sharing obligations."</p><p>By virtue of not being Dan Snyder, Harris and Johnson will already receive plenty of goodwill from the fanbase, and nobody will expect them to turn the Commanders into a Super Bowl contender overnight.</p><p>But the new ownership regime certainly has a lot of work ahead to undo all of the damage from the Snyder era.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ2eBd3%2BMnZinZaOjxqWx0axkb5pdmLyuucCnm56qo2LAorjEZquoZZqkwKl5x5qpq6GjYrqis8icZKOnmKPAsLqMoKmoraBirrG80aitnpxdl8ZuusWl</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdan-snyder-s-6b-commanders-sale-to-josh-harris-magic-johnson-group-approved-by-nfl-news-scores.html&text=Dan%20Snyder%27s%20%246B%20Commanders%20Sale%20to%20Josh%20Harris%2c%20Magic%20Johnson%20Group%20Approved%20by%20NFL%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdan-snyder-s-6b-commanders-sale-to-josh-harris-magic-johnson-group-approved-by-nfl-news-scores.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdan-snyder-s-6b-commanders-sale-to-josh-harris-magic-johnson-group-approved-by-nfl-news-scores.html&title=Dan%20Snyder%27s%20%246B%20Commanders%20Sale%20to%20Josh%20Harris%2c%20Magic%20Johnson%20Group%20Approved%20by%20NFL%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdan-snyder-s-6b-commanders-sale-to-josh-harris-magic-johnson-group-approved-by-nfl-news-scores.html&title=Dan%20Snyder%27s%20%246B%20Commanders%20Sale%20to%20Josh%20Harris%2c%20Magic%20Johnson%20Group%20Approved%20by%20NFL%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdan-snyder-s-6b-commanders-sale-to-josh-harris-magic-johnson-group-approved-by-nfl-news-scores.html&title=Dan%20Snyder%27s%20%246B%20Commanders%20Sale%20to%20Josh%20Harris%2c%20Magic%20Johnson%20Group%20Approved%20by%20NFL%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdan-snyder-s-6b-commanders-sale-to-josh-harris-magic-johnson-group-approved-by-nfl-news-scores.html&description=Dan%20Snyder%27s%20%246B%20Commanders%20Sale%20to%20Josh%20Harris%2c%20Magic%20Johnson%20Group%20Approved%20by%20NFL%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./diego-tinoco-bio-age-net-worth-salary-height-single-nationality-body-measurement-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diego Tinoco - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Salary, Height, Single, Nationality, Body Measurement, Career">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./christina-ricci-pregnant-expecting-first-child-see-her-baby-bump.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christina Ricci Pregnant, Expecting First Child: See Her Baby Bump">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
