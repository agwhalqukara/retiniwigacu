These songs ultimately never found widespread recognition, however, they marked the beginning of an explosive career.</strong></p><p>Read more about Sam Smith’s life and career so far.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-embed-aspect-4-3"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Childhood</h2><p>Sam Smith <a href=# rel=noopener>grew up in England</a> and spent their early years in a modest, two-bedroom house.</p><p>However, when their mother got a high salaried position working for a well-known bank, their lifestyles changed. They moved to the affluent county of Cambridgeshire, which is where Smith found a passion for singing.</p><p>At the age of only eight years old, they were performing for family and friends. Soon, they were having private vocal lessons.</p><p>As a teen, they got their first manager, with their sights set on a career in music, however, the family faced new challenges. Accused of spending her working hours to manage Smith’s career, their mother was fired from her job, leaving the family financially struggling.</p><p>“The climb to money was sudden,” they tell the <a href=# rel=noopener>Guardian</a>. “We were doing nicer things, building, traveling around the world. But just as quick as the climb was the decline…I really do know more what it’s like to be poor than I know what it’s like to be rich.”</p><p>Throughout their teenage years, their father played an active role in building their career by driving them to studios and encouraging them to work on their weight.</p><p>“I was a very big teenager,” they explain.</p><p>When Smith was 18, their parents split, and they moved to London to pursue their music career. Their success did not come immediately, with Smith having to work as a cleaner to sustain themselves.</p><p>“I was 19, and all my friends were at university and traveling and I was stuck in London cleaning toilets,” they say. “I was like, no, if it doesn’t happen next year I’m going to leave and travel and see the world.”</p><p>It was at this point that they wrote the tune <a href=# rel=noopener>‘Little Sailor</a>’ which details their struggle to make it as an artist.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Career</h2><p>Their career so far had seen Smith use six different managers, but it was the seventh that saw their career take off.</p><p>Elvin Smith, the seventh manager, had previously been a singer himself. He introduced Smith to Jimmy Napes, a songwriter, who had an association with <a href=# rel=noopener>Disclosure</a>.</p><p>Sam Smith provided the vocals to Disclosure’s single ‘Latch’, a song that has now reached over a million <a href=# rel=noopener>downloads in the US</a>. The following year, they collaborated with Naughty Boy on ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>La La La</a>’.</p><p>Smith, however, would go on to become more than a featured artist. In 2014, they released their debut album, ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>In The Lonely Hour</a>’.</p><p>‘Stay With Me’, a romantic track addressing a heartbreaking split, became a standout single. The song reached number 2 in the US charts, paving the way for Smith’s success as a solo artist.</p><p>Their romantic songs address their past and present relationships, and they have spoken honestly about this in interviews. In 2019, Smith announced that they are nonbinary, an issue they had discussed with <a href=# rel=noopener>GQ</a> only a few months prior.</p><p>‘<a href=# rel=noopener>The Thrill of it All</a>’, their second studio album, followed ‘In The Lonely Hour’. The album was described by <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> as “Easily one the best pop albums of the year.”</p><p>Smith has been nominated for six <a href=# rel=noopener>Grammy awards</a>, having won four of those. They have also had six singles reach the top ten of <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard’s Hot 100 Chart</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>There is one accolade that they boast that is perhaps the most exclusive of all. For the James Bond film ‘Spectre’, they created the track ‘Writing’s On The Wall’ – a song that would make Smith an <a href=# rel=noopener>Oscar</a> winner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfmqxdrK60edKapGarnZ7Bqb%2BMn6Crq6RiwLC6xmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-was-sam-smith-s-first-song.html&text=What%20Was%20Sam%20Smith%27s%20First%20Song%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-was-sam-smith-s-first-song.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-sam-smith-s-first-song.html&title=What%20Was%20Sam%20Smith%27s%20First%20Song%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-was-sam-smith-s-first-song.html&title=What%20Was%20Sam%20Smith%27s%20First%20Song%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-was-sam-smith-s-first-song.html&title=What%20Was%20Sam%20Smith%27s%20First%20Song%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-was-sam-smith-s-first-song.html&description=What%20Was%20Sam%20Smith%27s%20First%20Song%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-s-in-my-bag-candice-swanepoel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What's In My Bag: Candice Swanepoel">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./suns-chris-paul-says-he-s-now-sort-of-addicted-to-playing-in-nba-finals-news-scores-highlight.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suns' Chris Paul Says He's Now 'Sort of Addicted' to Playing in NBA Finals | News, Scores, Highlight">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
