The 14-year-old’s claim to fame at this time is his familial relationship as Wanda Sykes’s son.</p><p>There is not so much that is known about Lucas, but as mentioned earlier, his mother, Wanda Sykes, is a distinguished American actress, writer, and stand-up comedian. She is an Emmy award winner that became famous for her work on the Chris Rock Show in 1999. In addition to this, she has been named one of the 25 Funniest People in America.</p><h3><strong>Summary Lucas Claude Sykes’ Biography&nbsp;</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Lucas Claude Sykes</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> April 27, 2009</li><li><strong>Lucas Claude Sykes’ Age:</strong> 14 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Mixed</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Taurus</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Lucas Claude Sykes’ Parents:</strong> Wande Yvette Sykes and Alexander Sykes</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Olivia Lou Sykes (twin sister)</li><li><strong>Lucas Claude Sykes’ Grandparents:</strong> Harry Ellsworth Sykes and Marion Louise Sykes</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being the twin son of American comedienne, Wanda Sykes</li></ul><h2><strong>Lucas Claude Sykes is an American Citizen</strong></h2><p>Lucas Claude Sykes was born in the United States of America – the self-styled “land of the free.” He was precisely born in Media, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, on the 27th of April 2009. Lucas’ birth was somewhat special as he did not come into the world alone – he is a twin, and so he was born alongside his twin sister, Olivia. He (and his twin sister) is currently 14 years old.</p><p>This biography is written because he was born into a famous family with celebrity parents – and talking about celebrities, the profile can’t be more compelling than that of American comedienne Wanda Yvette Sykes. Yes, Lucas Sykes was born to Wanda Sykes and her wife, Alexander Sykes. And while Wanda is a stand-up comedian and actress, Lucas’ other mother, Alexander, is a businesswoman.</p><p>Moreso, Wanda Sykes’ son has a mixed ethnic heritage. His parents, Wanda and Alex, have African-American and French ethnic backgrounds, respectively, but for his nationality, Lucas Claude Sykes is American.</p><p>Currently, he is being raised by his parents in the US. He should be in a reputable school close to his home, although the details of his educational journey are not available on the internet. This is because he is being raised under the radar and away from the media.</p><p>As a growing child, Lucas speaks English and French fluently. His mother, Alex, is a Frenchwoman, and she teaches her children how to speak her native language. Thus, Lucas is having a great time with his family.</p><h2><strong>Who Is Lucas Claude Sykes’ Biological Father?</strong></h2><p>Lucas Claude Sykes’ father is unknown. The reason this question is been asked in the first instance is that he was born to a lesbian couple which means both of his parents are women. However, nothing is known about who his father (the sperm donor) is, and consequently, the identity of his dad remains a mystery.</p><p>Wanda Sykes’ son is a fraternal twin. As a dizygotic twin, he shared a womb with his sister, Olivia. He was born to Wanda’s wife, Alex.</p><h2><strong>Lucas Claude Sykes’ Parents are Still Together</strong></h2><p>Lucas Claude Sykes’ parents have been married since 2008. This couple met in 2006 and fell deeply in love with each other. After dating for over two years, they decided to tie the knot on October 25, 2008. They had a private wedding ceremony and rocked matching outfits on their day.</p><p>In October 2021, these lovebirds celebrated 13 years of being together. Alex took to her Instagram story to celebrate their anniversary. She sweetly explained that her husband, Wanda Sykes loves her even more. In addition to this, Wanda told her wife how much she loves her in French on 2022 Valentine’s Day.</p><p>Before her marriage to Alexander Niedbalski, Wanda Sykes was in a heterosexual relationship as she was married to legendary American producer <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Dave Hall</a>, and their union lasted from 1991 to 1998. They had no child together because Wanda never had plans of being a mother till she met Alex. During those seven years, Wanda explained that she was suppressing her real sexuality.</p><p>After the divorce from Hall, Sykes remained single until she made her sexual preference public and married Alex Niedbalski in November 2008. The story is different for Alex Niedbalski, who has never been married before – until Wanda Sykes.</p><h2><strong>How Many Siblings Does Lucas Claude Sykes Have?</strong></h2><p>Lucas Claude Sykes has only one sibling. He is a fraternal twin and shared his mother’s womb with his only sister, Olivia Lou Sykes. They were both born on April 27, 2009. Therefore, both siblings are 14 years old.</p><p>Similarly, neither of their parents has a child from a previous relationship. So, Lucas Claude does not have a half-sibling either. In addition to this, there is no information on the internet about his cousins and friends.</p><h2><strong>What Does Lucas Claude Sykes Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>Wanda Sykes’ son is a superstar’s child. So, his net worth is unavailable. He is very young and lives on his parents’ wealth and affluence. Currently, he is more focused on his educational pursuit.</p><p>Young Mr. Lucas has not disclosed his career choice to the public yet. There are also no traces of him doing comedy like his mom. Yet, fans have high hopes that he will join his mothers in the entertainment industry.</p><p>Additionally, Lucas Claude is not available on any social media platforms. He lives a private life courtesy of his parents.&nbsp; They keep him and his sister away from the prying eyes of the public. Thus, the information about him is revealed by his mother, Wanda.</p><p>However, Lucas Claude Sykes’ mom, Wanda Sykes, is a renowned American comedian. She is recognized as one of the funniest people in America. Wanda is well known for her surreal humor and her exceptional ability to make people happy.</p><p>She is also an actress and has starred in movies such as My Super Ex-girlfriend, Evan Almighty, and Monster-in-law. In addition to being an actress, she works as a writer. She is a Primetime Emmy Award winner for her work on the Chris Rock Show, and she has a net worth of $10 million.</p><p>On the flip side, Lucas’ other mom, Alexander Sykes, is a businesswoman. She is into kitchen top decor. The details of her business are not public, but she has a net worth of about $5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLm2r8CsZJykkaqxpnnSsqKeq12ewG7DwKebmmWjrrimv4yspqdll5rBbsDOZqKnp6ditaq5jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flucas-claude-sykes-is-wanda-sykes-son.html&text=Lucas%20Claude%20Sykes%20is%20Wanda%20Sykes%27%20Son&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flucas-claude-sykes-is-wanda-sykes-son.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flucas-claude-sykes-is-wanda-sykes-son.html&title=Lucas%20Claude%20Sykes%20is%20Wanda%20Sykes%27%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flucas-claude-sykes-is-wanda-sykes-son.html&title=Lucas%20Claude%20Sykes%20is%20Wanda%20Sykes%27%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flucas-claude-sykes-is-wanda-sykes-son.html&title=Lucas%20Claude%20Sykes%20is%20Wanda%20Sykes%27%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flucas-claude-sykes-is-wanda-sykes-son.html&description=Lucas%20Claude%20Sykes%20is%20Wanda%20Sykes%27%20Son" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./now-92-the-track-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Now 92: The Track List">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./history-s-10-worst-execution-methods-ever-devised.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="History's 10 Worst Execution Methods Ever Devised">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
