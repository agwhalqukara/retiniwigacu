"I used to think 'me time' was so narcissistic, but now I realize it's necessary. I have a SoulCycle bike, and I love to do that. I am a hot-bath fanatic.

"If I can find a treadmill at a hotel — which most most hotels have one — I can get some sort of something in. Or just free weights or bands. I usually travel with mini bands in my suitcase, because they don't take up much room, or a collapsible ab wheel that you can take apart, something that's small. Those things are just easy to have in your suitcase, and it's saved me on many occasions. If you do find yourself in a space that doesn't have the best gym or it's super crowded, I could just stay in my room and feel like I got a good workout in."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_2151361371.jpg><p><span>Keith Urban opened up about his sobriety to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><i><span>Interview</span></i></a><i><span>. </span></i><span>"My wife put an intervention together and it was … it was divine.

"It is torture sometimes trying to eat healthy on the road, but I try my best," she said </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>in a 2014 interview</span></a><span>. "It's all about balance and still letting my tastebuds enjoy themselves. If there's a reason to celebrate or I'm somewhere that has some kind of food that I know I won't be able to resist, then I try to eat lighter all around that. Also, I try to eliminate carbs and most processed foods."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_2257232739.jpg><p><span>Sheryl Crow shared some of her favorite workouts with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>InStyle</span></a><span>. "Exercise is really important to me. Whether it's going for a jog or getting on my rowing machine, it's a great way of burning through some of that unnecessary anxiety. I have one of the machines with water in it — it's low-impact and core- and back-strengthening."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_732597832.jpg><p><span>Faith Hill makes sure to eat healthy. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>In an interview with Self</span></a><span>, she revealed that she eats a lot of salad.

"A lot of people want to do everything cold turkey whether you're trying to quit smoking or quit eating McDonalds. It's hard to just say, 'I'm done today.' When I was first starting out, it was like, 'This week I'm not going to eat dairy' or 'This week I'm not gonna eat bread.' All of a sudden you start sleeping better. You start waking up better. You start having more energy during the day when you don't have all those bad things in your body. Once your brain starts to get accustomed to good things going in your body it starts to reject the bad stuff."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_675515182.jpg><p><span>Chris Young revealed his weight loss </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>on Instagram</span></a><span>.

"I don't really get tired of training," McGraw said to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Men's Health</span></a><span>. "There's such a feeling of accomplishment that comes from the feeling of being my age and still being at the top of my game. I use my whole body to sing—my legs, my butt.

I had to say, 'OK big boy, I can't handle this. This is way over my pay grade — I don't know what to do,'" she recalls. "And I would wait, and he would guide me. And so without my faith, I have no idea where I would be or my career would be at this time today."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_1460342522.jpg><p><span>Florida Georgia Line member, Tyler Hubbard, shared some of his workout secrets with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Muscle and Fitness</span></a><span>.

"</span><span>First off, having a family while also being on the move so much, and having to travel constantly, you want to savor every second you can. So the fact that I can walk out to my garage, get on my bike, and immediately be working out is a huge benefit—rather than having to get into my car, commute, park, and try to squeeze in a session. Next I would say I love cruising in my neighborhood. From my house going south it's just some of the best road cycling you could dream up. The roads are built on this hard Tennessee limestone—real smooth, no cracks or bumps. The hills are incredible, especially in the fall when the leaves are changing. There are these great routes where you go under amazing canopy."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_1362874478.jpg><p><span>Dierks Bentley talked about his diet in an interview with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Tennessean</span></a><span>. "One of the coolest things when you get to headline and things are going well, you get your own catering. When you have that, you can be more conscious of what you're eating. I used to pride myself on how many White Castle hamburger cartons I could have piled up on the floor board of my truck. I thought it was cool.

"I do a lot of cardio. My wife Tiffany and I have been doing spin class, which is a lot of fun. I try and do as much cardio as I can, light on the weights. I don't try and lift that much. I try to work on agility and stretch. I like yoga. It's very relaxing."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/shutterstock_1367058755.jpg><p><span>Chris Lane tells The Tennessean that he loves working out with others. "It's always good to have someone who can push you. If I'm by myself, I'll try and find a gym and stick with similar routines that he showed me, which is more CrossFit than anything. The eating aspect is a lot of it. I have a couple of days a week that I'll do a cheat meal. I'll try and stick with as healthy options as possible and stay away from as much bread as possible."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/shutterstock_1074627479.jpg><p><span>Singer Cassadee Pope tells The Tennessean that she's learned to be consistent with workouts. "Through the years, I've kind of figured out how to figure out how to balance work and staying fit. It's really hard, especially being in small towns that don't have a yoga or Pilates studio and gyms are about 30 minutes away. You can't make excuses. If there's no gym to go to, I'll do some plyometric kind of stuff and jump around and get my heart rate up."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/GettyImages-1141216221.jpg><p><span>Dan Smyers is the other half of Dan + Shay. He revealed that he made a change to his diet to The Tennessean.&nbsp; "In the last couple of years, I switched to an all-vegetarian diet. I try to be as vegan as possible. Since I switched to that diet, I've had way more energy and I'm more focused. Everybody asks where you get your protein, and there's a brand called Vega and it's incredible and they have all plant-based protein. I've been hooked, the flavors of the protein powders, mocha, chocolate, I make all kinds of shakes."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKK5wLOgp59dl7yltcSsZKieXaOutLTVoqOlnV2owaK%2B0mg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f20-amazing-bodies-of-nashville-stars.html&text=20%20Amazing%20Bodies%20of%20Nashville%20Stars&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20-amazing-bodies-of-nashville-stars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-amazing-bodies-of-nashville-stars.html&title=20%20Amazing%20Bodies%20of%20Nashville%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f20-amazing-bodies-of-nashville-stars.html&title=20%20Amazing%20Bodies%20of%20Nashville%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f20-amazing-bodies-of-nashville-stars.html&title=20%20Amazing%20Bodies%20of%20Nashville%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-amazing-bodies-of-nashville-stars.html&description=20%20Amazing%20Bodies%20of%20Nashville%20Stars" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lauren-london-and-reginae-carter-post-rare-photo-and-video-of-lil-wayne-s-son-kameron-on-his-bir.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lauren London And Reginae Carter Post Rare Photo And Video Of Lil Waynes Son, Kameron, On His Bir">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./uif-contact-details-numbers-call-center-and-email-address.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="UIF Contact Details - Numbers, Call Center and Email Address">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
