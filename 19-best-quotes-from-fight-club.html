It might not be a pretty one, but it’s a tale of repressed rage, corporate monotony, homoerotic overtones, insomnia, nihilism, anarchism versus consumerism, and splicing of porno frames into family-friendly movies struck a chord with audiences across the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Satirical Movies To Watch If You Like Fight Club</a></span></p><p>David Fincher’s oddball, yet relatively faithful adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk’s darkly comic novel might not have been a huge box office success when it was first released, but it has certainly gained a massive cult following in the years since.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><strong>Updated on January 31st, 2022 by Ben Hathaway:&nbsp;</strong>David Fincher’s adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk’s masterful book is just as quotable as the nihilistic source material. This means that there’s no shortage of options when it comes to fans choosing their favorite bits of Fight Club dialogue.</p><h2>Tyler’s Idea of Etiquette</h2><h3>“Now, A Question Of Etiquette – As I Pass, Do I Give You The Ass Or The Crotch?”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Tyler Durden&nbsp;sets up his rude form of dominance right off the bat. When he’s introduced, The Narrator is on an airplane, with the seat next to him being empty. Durden’s back takes up most of the camera frame and he mulls on airplane etiquette with “Now, a question of etiquette – as I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?”</p><p>It’s a funny line, but it’s also relatable.&nbsp;A lot of people have been on an airplane or walked down the aisle at a dark movie theater and asked themselves the same question. Durden is just the ruder version of the common man (the Narrator), which is in and of itself a <a href=#>subtle clue to the film’s ending</a>.</p><h2>The Narrator Is In A Lot of Trouble</h2><h3>“You Said You Would Definitely Say That.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Once the Narrator is coming to the realization about Tyler Durden’s true identity, he enters a police station in a city far away from home. However, once the Captain has left, the officers seem to know him anyway. Durden’s already been here, he’s already been everywhere. The officers are in on it even more than the Narrator who gave them specific directions as Tyler.</p><p>The Narrator stands there trying to explain things, but the officers/Fight Club members know more than he does. They’re a step ahead, and when he tries to explain further they merely say “You definitely said you would say that.” It’s one of the most unforgettably shocking moments of the movie.</p><h2>A Morbid Thought From The Narrator</h2><h3>“On A Long Enough Timeline, The Survival Rate For Everyone Drops To Zero.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>“On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.” These words from the Narrator&nbsp;are&nbsp;the&nbsp;epitome of&nbsp;Fight Club. Life isn’t limitless, and the Narrator knows that, but he doesn’t know how to fully grasp that knowledge in a way that’s beneficial not just to others, but to himself as well.</p><p>He works in the risk management section of the automobile insurance industry. He’s seen more than his fair share of death and has been forced to think of those deaths as numbers. Before long,&nbsp;he starts thinking in terms of survival rates. It’s just one of&nbsp;<a href=#>Fight Club</a><a href=#>‘s more morbidly beautiful quotes</a>.</p><h2>Tyler Gets A Surprise</h2><h3>“You Hit Me In The Ear!”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>The intensity of the fight sequences is just one thing about Fincher’s&nbsp;<a href=#>Fight Club&nbsp;that holds up today</a>. They’re visceral, unexpected, even outright bizarre.</p><p>They can&nbsp;also be very humorous, no more so than when Tyler Durden shouts out the iconic line “You hit me in the ear!” He’s goaded the Narrator into a fistfight. The Narrator, naturally, is inexperienced and his punch lands with an awkward thud. The genuine surprise in Pitt’s delivery makes the quote unforgettable.</p><h2>Marla’s Philosophy</h2><h3>“Marla’s Philosophy Of Life Is That She Might Die At Any Moment. The Tragedy, She Said, Was That She Didn’t.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Marla Singer goes a long way towards making&nbsp;Fight Club&nbsp;memorable. Her worldview isn’t all that dissimilar from Tyler Durden/The Narrator’s, and they serve to accentuate one another. She sees little point in all of this and makes an equal point of showing it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Movies That Subtly Spoil The Ending Early On</a></span></p><p>Or, as the Narrator tells the viewer, “Marla’s philosophy of life is that she might die at any moment. The tragedy, she said, was that she didn’t.” She doesn’t want to live life to the fullest and she doesn’t much care for understanding it, but she does have insight, even if it is as warped and jaded as the Narrator’s.</p><h2>The Clock Is Ticking</h2><h3>“This Is Your Life, And It’s Ending One Minute At A Time.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Time flies by, so it’s never a bad idea to appreciate life and live in the moment. Fight Club might not seem like the kind of movie to preach that message, but in its own way, that’s what this story tells&nbsp;people to do.</p><p>The Narrator provides this timeless nugget of wisdom when he talks about traveling for work: “You wake up at SeaTac, SFO, LAX. You wake up at O’Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, BWI. Pacific, mountain, central. Lose an hour, gain an hour. This is your life, and it’s ending one minute at a time.”</p><h2>Tyler’s Idea Of A Motivational Quote</h2><h3>“If You Aren’t On Your Way To Becoming A Vet In Six Weeks, You Will Be Dead.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Tyler Durden wants people to stop procrastinating following their goals. He wants them to seize the day. He wants them to stop making excuses and start doing what they can to make their dreams come true.</p><p>But he goes about it in a more extreme way than most self-help gurus, telling an aspiring veterinarian, “If you aren’t on your way to becoming a vet in six weeks, you will be dead.” It’s an odd but memorable take on the classic motivational quote structure.</p><h2>Tyler Makes An Odd Request</h2><h3>“I Want You To Hit Me As Hard As You Can.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Fight Club preaches that fighting can be a cathartic experience. It all begins when the Narrator tells Tyler about his problems and Tyler tells the Narrator to “hit me as hard as you can.”</p><p>In the film, the ear punch is a surprise to Tyler. On the set, it was a surprise to Brad Pitt, too. He was expecting a pretend hit, but <a href=#>David Fincher told Edward Norton to hit him for real</a>.</p><h2>Fight Club On Freedom</h2><h3>“It’s Only After We’ve Lost Everything That We’re Free To Do Anything.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Having an apartment and a bunch of possessions can be restricting.&nbsp;Having bills to pay gives people something to lose.</p><p>In Fight Club, the Narrator loses everything when his apartment is destroyed, and it frees him up to follow his heart and start an underground anarchist group. However, the phrase is powerful enough to inspire people to do more positive things with their lives too.</p><h2>Fight Club On Mortality</h2><h3>“First, You’ve Gotta Know – Not Fear, Know – That Someday, You’re Gonna Die.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>According to Tyler Durden, this is the key to living life to the full. If&nbsp;people are afraid of death, then&nbsp;they won’t really experience life. People&nbsp;won’t do anything risky or dangerous or life-threatening or exhilarating if&nbsp;their main priority is not dying.</p><p>When Tyler gets the Narrator to know, and not fear, that he is going to die one day, he starts setting up his ring of anarchism and rallying an army against the advertising industry. This isn’t necessarily the way to fully experience life, but it’s a start: “First, you’ve gotta know – not fear, know – that someday, you’re gonna die.”</p><h2>The Narrator On Insomnia</h2><h3>“When You Have Insomnia, You’re Never Really Asleep…And You’re Never Really Awake.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>As with most of his film’s subjects, David Fincher does a fantastic job of depicting and framing insomnia in Fight Club. It’s partly down to Edward Norton’s impeccable performance, but a lot of it is in the camera angles chosen by Fincher’s regular cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and editing and color-grading choices made by his editor James Haygood.</p><p>It’s simply a strong command of the magic of the movies and the horrors of experiencing insomnia are summed up beautifully in one single line of voiceover narration: “When you have insomnia, you’re never really asleep…and you’re never really awake.” That’s pretty much it in a nutshell. It’s a nightmare.</p><h2>The Narrator Or Jack?</h2><h3>“I Am Jack’s Complete Lack Of Surprise.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>The fact that Edward Norton’s Narrator character continually uses the phrase “I am Jack’s…” has led some people to think that Jack is the character’s name. In fact, screenwriter Jim Uhls called him “Jack” in the script. But it’s like <a href=#>Benicio del Toro’s character, “DJ”, from The Last Jedi</a>.</p><p>The character doesn’t actually have a name, but they need a placeholder name for scripts and call sheets, otherwise production would get very confusing. The phrase simply refers to the average man. He got it from a magazine. It’s just that the Narrator takes it one step further with dark twists on it, like “I am Jack’s wasted life,” and “I am Jack’s smirking revenge.”</p><h2>Marla On Cinderella Stories</h2><h3>“A Condom Is The Glass Slipper Of Our Generation.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>A lot of love from Fight Club fans is directed at Tyler Durden and the Narrator, but Marla Singer is a great character, too. Helena Bonham Carter plays her every whim perfectly.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>5 Reasons Cliff Booth Is&nbsp;Brad Pitt’s Best Character (& 5 Why It’s Still Tyler Durden)</a></span></p><p>Her explanation of why <a href=#>Cinderella</a> stories are dead is one for the ages: “A condom is the glass slipper of our generation. You slip one on when you meet a stranger. You dance all night, and then you throw it away. The condom, I mean, not the stranger.”</p><h2>Tyler Delivers One Of Fight Club’s Most Famous Quotes</h2><h3>“You Are Not Special. You Are Not A Beautiful Or Unique Snowflake. You Are The Same Decaying Organic Matter As Everything Else.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Though the sentiment has caused controversy for its association with certain kinds of political discourse, Tyler’s speech to his followers remains one of the most iconic moments in&nbsp;Fight Club.</p><p>He lines them up and tells them, “Listen up, maggots! You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else. We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.”</p><h2>The Narrator On Tyler’s Power</h2><h3>“In Tyler We Trusted.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>There’s a sort of sly, double-edged message to the Narrator’s claim when he says, “Tyler built himself an army. Why was Tyler Durden building an army? To what purpose? For what greater good? In Tyler we trusted.”</p><p>Tyler’s whole ethos is to go against what the corporations are telling&nbsp;people and go against what the government is telling people, but in doing so, he tells a bunch of people what they should be thinking and they continue to be mindless drones following what someone is telling them – they just swapped ads for Tyler Durden. The Narrator blindly follows Tyler – and trusts in him – without knowing his plan. Later in the movie, he realizes that Tyler is him, and he doesn’t know the purpose of his own army.</p><h2>Tyler Explains The Rules Of Fight Club</h2><h3>“The First Rule Of Fight Club Is: You Do Not Talk About Fight Club. The Second Rule Of Fight Club Is: You Do Not Talk About Fight Club.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>The rule’s so nice, they named it twice. Many people have tried to analyze exactly why Tyler Durden felt the need to make the first two rules of Fight Club the same. Simply put, it’s because he wanted to really implant the idea in these guys’ heads that Fight Club is a very secretive organization.</p><p>Don’t talk about it. Seriously, don’t talk about it. If he says it twice, it has more impact: “The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club.”</p><h2>The Narrator Makes An Understatement</h2><h3>“You Met Me At A Very Strange Time In My Life.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>This line should be included in every movie with a romantic subplot. Movies usually focus on the most interesting part of their lead character’s life, whether that is the time they became a superhero, the time they were pursued by a serial killer, or the time they rallied an army of Gen-Xers against the system.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Movies That Influenced David Fincher</a></span></p><p>Usually, during this time, due to the three-act structure, time constraints, and audience quadrants, the character will also fall in love, and all the other stuff that goes on gets in the way of it. The Narrator explains this to Marla in one sentence: “You met me at a very strange time in my life.”</p><h2>Tyler Durden On Owning Things</h2><h3>“The Things You Own End Up Owning You.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>Many viewers think that the message of Fight Club is anti-consumerist. They think it’s a movie that critiques all the systems that are in place, like banks and corporations and products. But Tyler Durden is clearly posed as the villain.</p><p>Everything he does is framed as the wrong thing to do, and at the end of the movie, as all the banks’ headquarters burn to the ground, there’s not a sense of hope, but rather a sense of dread. Still, early on in the movie, Tyler makes a very strong point about consumerist culture: “The things you own end up owning you.”</p><h2>Tyler Durden On Adverstising</h2><h3>“Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s*** we don’t need.”</h3><figure class=item-img></figure><p>This Tyler Durden monologue is simply iconic: “Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who’ve ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. Goddamn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s*** we don’t need. We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars, but we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very p***** off.”</p><p>Though Tyler may not be the hero that some make him out to be, some of the character’s insights into advertising and media ring true even today for fans.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>I Am Jack’s 10 Behind-The-Scenes Facts About Fight Club</a></span></p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>Every On-Screen Sean Bean Death</span></strong></p><p><strong class=section-sub-title>About The Author</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SR-Profile-Pic.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><strong class=bio-title><br>Ben Sherlock<br><span class=amount>(3282 Articles Published)</span><br></strong><p>Ben Sherlock is a writer, comedian, and independent filmmaker.
