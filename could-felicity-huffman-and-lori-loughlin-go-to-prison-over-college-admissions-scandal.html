The actresses were indicted earlier this week – along with 48 others – for being part of a nationwide conspiracy that involved cheating on college entrance exams and lying about being athletic recruits to gain entrance to elite universities. Does this mean that Loughlin and Huffman will go to prison?</p><p>According to People Magazine, Loughlin – known for her role as Aunt Becky on Full House – allegedly paid $500,000 to say that her two daughters were designated recruits of the rowing team in order to gain entrance to the University of Southern California. And, Huffman allegedly gave $15,000 for her oldest daughter to participate in the college entrance exam cheating scheme.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Hollywood community remains outraged by the claims against Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin and the 40 others charged in the <a href=# rel=nofollow>#CollegeCheatingScandal</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/BfVnFlrwtB</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/pyzZSbDpGl</a></p><p>— The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 14, 2019</a></p><p>Legal expert James J. Leonard Jr. says that both actresses could see prison time, but the chances are slim.</p><p>“This is a federal prosecution brought forth by the Department of Justice that carries with it potential life-altering consequences for those involved. The stakes could not be higher,” says Leonard.&nbsp; “A custodial term is always a possibility when you are charged with felonies. The question to ask is if it’s a probability, and in this case, I don’t see it as a probability with respect to the parents involved.”</p><p>Leonard says that when it comes down to it, they are parents that crossed the line when trying to help their children.</p><p>Loughlin’s daughter Olivia Jade is a popular YouTube influencer, and last year she posted a video about what she was looking forward to when going to college. However, she faced backlash after she admitted that for her, college would be all about the parties.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Many experts weren't surprised about this scandal. They say it was a natural next step in a world of college admissions that has long favored the rich at the expense of the poor.<a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/oX7dwODtWV</a></p><p>— USA TODAY (@USATODAY) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 13, 2019</a></p><p>“I don’t know how much of school I’m gonna attend, but I’m gonna go in and talk to my deans and everyone, and hope that I can try and balance it all,” Jade said. “But I do want the experience of like game days, partying…I don’t really care about school, as you guys all know.”</p><p>Fans immediately posted comments calling Jade “ungrateful” and “privileged,” and many were disappointed that Jade’s approach to her expensive education was about partying instead of learning. Some asked why she would even go to college if she hates school so much, and others said it was insulting for her to say those things when many people want to go to college but can’t afford it.</p><p>One fan sarcastically commented that all they were doing was going to college because they were the first person in their family to do so, and to get a degree and better opportunities.</p><p>Jade ended up posting an apology video and admitted that she said things that were “super ignorant and stupid.” She explained that she never intended to come across as ungrateful or that she didn’t care, and she was disappointed in herself.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Boha1SdgrXK/</p><p>Olivia Jade said that she didn’t mean to offend anyone, and she knows that going to a “really nice school” is a privilege and a blessing.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Neither Felicity Huffman or Lori Loughlin have publicly commented on the scandal.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTpMKtsIyfnKWhk57BunnHrp2fpZGjeqK6w2ajqKqZYrmwwcaho6KmXZy8bsDOZqeroaOku2671Z6pZpufobmms8RmmJ2lmajAqrvNrGSsm5GjsaK4jGtsb25ja3w%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcould-felicity-huffman-and-lori-loughlin-go-to-prison-over-college-admissions-scandal.html&text=Could%20Felicity%20Huffman%20And%20Lori%20Loughlin%20Go%20To%20Prison%20Over%20College%20Admissions%20Scandal%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcould-felicity-huffman-and-lori-loughlin-go-to-prison-over-college-admissions-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcould-felicity-huffman-and-lori-loughlin-go-to-prison-over-college-admissions-scandal.html&title=Could%20Felicity%20Huffman%20And%20Lori%20Loughlin%20Go%20To%20Prison%20Over%20College%20Admissions%20Scandal%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcould-felicity-huffman-and-lori-loughlin-go-to-prison-over-college-admissions-scandal.html&title=Could%20Felicity%20Huffman%20And%20Lori%20Loughlin%20Go%20To%20Prison%20Over%20College%20Admissions%20Scandal%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcould-felicity-huffman-and-lori-loughlin-go-to-prison-over-college-admissions-scandal.html&title=Could%20Felicity%20Huffman%20And%20Lori%20Loughlin%20Go%20To%20Prison%20Over%20College%20Admissions%20Scandal%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcould-felicity-huffman-and-lori-loughlin-go-to-prison-over-college-admissions-scandal.html&description=Could%20Felicity%20Huffman%20And%20Lori%20Loughlin%20Go%20To%20Prison%20Over%20College%20Admissions%20Scandal%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-difference-between-hormonal-acne-and-bacterial-acne.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Difference Between Hormonal Acne And Bacterial Acne">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./blac-chyna-how-she-reversed-her-cosmetic-procedures-and-embraced-her-natural-beauty.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Blac Chyna: How She Reversed Her Cosmetic Procedures and Embraced Her Natural Beauty">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
